# Code Under the Hood

A personal repository documenting my journey to master the core principles of computing, low-level programming, and modern software development. This repository includes my hands-on practice with C and C++, covering topics like computer architecture, operating systems, data structures, concurrency, and networking.

## Key Areas of Focus:
- Understanding computers "under the hood," from hardware to software.
- Learning and implementing concepts from foundational computing books.
- Practicing C programming for low-level system understanding.
- Transitioning to modern C++ with a focus on clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
- Exploring advanced topics like concurrency, networking, and software design patterns.

## Contents:
1. **Foundations**: Exercises and notes from foundational computing books:
   - *But How Do It Know?* by J. Clark Scott
   - *Inside the Machine* by Jon Stokes
   - *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau

2. **C Programs**: Practice problems and projects based on:
   - *The C Programming Language* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie

3. **C++ Projects**: Code and projects inspired by:
   - *Programming Principles and Practice Using C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup
   - *C++ Best Practices* by Jason Turner
   - *C++ 17 in Detail* by B. Filipek
   - *Beautiful C++: 30 Core Guidelines* by J. Davidson
   - *C++ Software Design* by Klaus Iglberger

4. **Advanced Topics**: Exploring:
   - *C++ Concurrency in Action* by Anthony Williams
   - *TCP/IP Illustrated: The Protocols, Volume 1* by Kevin Fall

5. **Projects**: Real-world applications to apply concepts learned during the journey:
   - Linked lists, hash tables, and other data structures.
   - Multithreaded applications and client-server systems.
   - Simulations, games, and more.

6. **Resources**: Summaries, notes, and additional insights from books and personal research.

## Why This Repository?
This project is a record of my progress as I dive deep into how computers work and how to write high-quality software. Itâ€™s an evolving collection of my code, notes, and reflections as I explore the world of low-level programming and software design.
